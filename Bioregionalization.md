## Network-based biogeography

Investigating the spatial structure of the marine biodiversity has long been an important area of biological and palaeontological research.  Biogeographic studies on fossil organisms have contributed to our current understanding of the relationship between plate tectonics, Earthâ€™s climate and the evolution of life. However, the impact of those studies extends beyond basic biogeographic questions to include, for example, conservation biology, regional geology, and stratigraphy. In this study we tested the traditional biogeographic scenario of the Albian Ammonoids using a network-based approach.
