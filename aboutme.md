I am a geologist, a paleontologist and a network scientists. My research program focuses on understanding the complex interactions between plate tectonics, climate and the evolution of life. I use an interdisciplinary approach that combines stratigraphy and paleobiology with spatial statistics and network science to address specific questions on spatiotemporal aspects of the fossil record.
