I am a geologist, a paleontologist and a network scientists. My research program is focused on understanding the complex interactions between plate tectonics, climate and the evolution of life. This interdisciplinary approach combines stratigraphy, paleobiology, spatial statistics and network science to address specific questions on spatiotemporal aspects of the fossil record.
