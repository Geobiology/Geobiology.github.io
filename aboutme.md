My research program focuses on understanding the multiscale interactions between biological, chemical, physical, and social components of the built and natural environment. I aim to answer the ultimate question of how the complex nature of life, climate, and society affect each other.

Science education at all levels is an integral component of my research program. As an educator, I aim to bridge the gap between state-of-the-art research and teaching practices by promoting data-driven learning and systems thinking in formal and non-formal educational environments.

Key words: _Nature, Society, Climate, Data-Driven Learning, Systems Thinking._
