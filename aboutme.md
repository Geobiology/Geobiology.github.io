I am a geologist, a paleontologist, and a network scientists. My research program is focused on understanding the interactions between plate tectonics, climate, and evolution of life as a complex system phenomenon. This interdisciplinary approach combines stratigraphy, paleobiology, and network science to address specific questions on spatiotemporal aspects of the fossil record.
