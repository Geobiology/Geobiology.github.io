subtitle: Higher-order network modeling of geohistorical data
---
My research program focuses on understanding the Earth-Life System through networks describing spatial and temporal interactions between biotic, abiotic, and social components. Using data extracted from different geohistorical records, I aim to answer the question of how the multilevel nature of life, climate, and society affect each other.  

Key words: _Macroevolution, Complex SystemsInter, disciplinary Research_
