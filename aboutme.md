I am a geologist, a paleontologist and a network scientists. My general research program focuses on understanding the complex interactions between plate tectonics, climate and the evolution of life. I am particularly interested in the processes that controls the stratigraphic distribution of fossils over large scales. I use an interdisciplinary approach that combines stratigraphy and paleobiology with spatial statistics and network science tools to address specific questions on spatiotemporal aspects of the biosedimentary record.
