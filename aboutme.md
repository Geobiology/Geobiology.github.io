My research program focuses on understanding the multiscale interactions between biological, chemical, physical, and social components of the built and natural environment. I aim to answer the ultimate question of how the complex nature of life, climate, and society affect each other.

Key words: _Evolution, Nature, Society, Climate, Environment, Complex Systems, Transdisciplinary Research._
