My interdisciplinary research program focuses on understanding the structure and dynamics of the biosphere through networks describing spatiotemporal interactions between biotic, abiotic, and social components. I aim to answer the question of how the multilevel nature of life, climate, and society affect each other. 

Key words: _Evolution, Nature (including Society), Climate, Complex Systems, Interdisciplinary Research._
