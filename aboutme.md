I am a geoscientist working beyond disciplinary boundaries. My research explores the multiscale interactions among biological, physical, and societal components of natural and built environments. I aim to answer the ultimate question of how the complex nature of life, climate, and society affects each other. 

Science education is an integral component of my research program. As an educatior, I aim to bridge the gap between research and teaching practices by promoting data-driven learning and systems thinking.

Key words: _Nature, Society, Climate, Data-Driven Learning, Systems Thinking._
