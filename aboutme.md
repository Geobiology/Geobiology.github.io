My research program focuses on understanding the multiscale interactions between biological, chemical, physical, and social components of the built and natural environment. I aim to answer the ultimate question of how the complex nature of life, climate, and society affect each other.

Geoscience education at all levels is an integral component of my research program and I use physical and abstracted (digital) geohistorical records for teaching in formal and informal learning settings.

Key words: _Evolution, Nature, Society, Climate, Environment, Complex Systems._
