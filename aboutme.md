subtitle: Higher-order network modeling of geohistorical data
---
My research program focuses on understanding the Earth-Life System through networks describing spatial and temporal interactions between biotic, abiotic, and social components. Using data extracted from diferent geohistorical records, I aim to answer the question of how the multilevel nature of life, climate, and society afect each other.  

Key words: _geohistorical records, multilayer networks, spatial statistics, geoinformatics._
